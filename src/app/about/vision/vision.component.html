          The vision of House of Faith is to empower others to serve mightily in the Kingdom of God. The Lord called us
          to a Saturday night work and showed us that the congregation would be made up of row upon row of Ministries;
          that those Ministries would gather together to worship and to be built up. Then they would disburse into the
          community, touching others for the Kingdomâ€™s Sake. Below are a few that always needs volunteers. Please pray
          about how you can get involved.
