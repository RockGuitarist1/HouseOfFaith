        <h4>Outreach</h4>
        <p>Mission Outreach is defined by Wikipedia as "an activity of providing services to those who might not otherwise have
          access to those services. A key component of outreach is that the groups providing it are not stationary, but mobile".
          This means we go to the needy; we set up shop where the hardship exists: loving and lifting, delivering services,
          educating and training, striving to be a change agent in the midst of the community.</p>
