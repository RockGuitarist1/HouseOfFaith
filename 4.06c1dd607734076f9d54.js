The song talks about a place open to the hurting and the lost, a place with rooms for the confused and the abused, a place where hands reach out to hold the weak and fallen, a place where there are no labels. Because the world is so quick to stick a label on you and no matter how much you try to change and outrun that label, you just can\'t. People come into the Barn and they tell us they feel like they\'ve finally come "home", right in the middle of a big family reunion at Thanksgiving time. They\'re welcomed with open arms and lots of hugs. At the Barn, they find people to help them unload their "stuff" and unpack it all, sort it, make sense of it and stash it away. One of my favorite testimonies is of a woman who had suffered with Schizophrenia since she was little. She was brought into the HoF family and surrounded with love. Sometimes she wanted to talk about her past and sometimes she just wanted to get a hug. One night during the worship service, Jesus touched her and the voices stopped. She\u2019s been free ever since and she knows it happened here because she felt safe enough to stay long enough to receive the healing the Lord has prepared for her.
